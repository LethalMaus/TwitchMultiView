## Introduction

This is a very basic website designed for watching up to 4 *Twitch Streams* at the same time on one screen.
This was originally planned to be a part of the StreamingYorkie Android App but due to device compatibility, it has be externalized as a Web Application.
This should be able to be played on any *Web Browser* on any *Device*.

No standards in HTML, JavaScript or CSS have been taken fully into consideration.
The structure, logic & styling have been kept very basic because of time constraints.

The code is **Open Source** & is open for further development as well as forking etc.
TwitchMultiView was developed with *Visual Studio* in *HTML, JavaScript & CSS*.

The website is hosted by GitHub
[TwitchMultiView](https://lethalmaus.github.io/TwitchMultiView/)
